    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Chris Cardimen. I'm a michigan-based software developer currently working at
        Jackson National Life. I specialize in full-stack development, website design, and video game development.</p>
    <h2>This website</h2>
    <p>This is my personal website, <a href="./index.html">chriscardimen.com</a>. I primarily use it as a portfolio and
        as a place to document my projects.</p>
    <h3>Source Code</h3>
    <p>The source code for this website is all publicly available on GitHub, under the <a
            href="https://github.com/chriscardimen/website-chriscardimen">website-chriscardimen</a> repository.</p>
    <p>The entire website has been handmade in raw HTML. If you want to see
        my work with an engine (Wordpress) that has more design features, check out the website I made for my wedding:
        <a href="https://cardimensteffywedding.com/">cardimensteffywedding.com</a>.
    <h3>CI/CD Pipeline</h3>
    The deployment automation of
    this site is done through a combination of Git (version control), cPanel (server hosting), and a cron job. When a
    change is
    merged into the main branch of this repo, cPanel's cron automation suite will kick off a job to
    execute a PHP script that fetches the latest updates to the repository's main branch and updates the site's
    contents.
    </p>
