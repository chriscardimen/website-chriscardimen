    <h1>Chris Cardimen</h1>
    <p>This is my personal website, <a href="./index.html">chriscardimen.com</a>.</p>
    <p>The source code for this website is all publicly available on GitHub, under the <a
            href="https://github.com/chriscardimen/website-chriscardimen">website-chriscardimen repository.</a></p>
    <p>The entire website has been handmade in classic barebones HTML - no web engines here! Though, if you want to see
        my work with an engine (WordPress), check out the website I made for my wedding: <a
            href="https://cardimensteffywedding.com/">cardimensteffywedding.com</a>. The deployment configuration of
        this site is done through a combination of Git and cPanel, which is the hosting site I use. When a change is
        merged into the main branch of this repo, cPanel has webhooks that will auto-deploy the changes to the directory
        in which this site is hosted.</p>
