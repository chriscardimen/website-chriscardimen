    <h1>Chris Cardimen</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This is my personal website, <a href="./index.html">chriscardimen.com</a>.</p>
    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    <p>The source code for this website is all publicly available on GitHub, under the <a
            href="https://github.com/chriscardimen/website-chriscardimen">website-chriscardimen repository</a>.</p>
    <p>The entire website has been handmade in classic barebones HTML - CSS here! Though, if you want to see
        my work with an engine (WordPress), check out the website I made for my wedding: <a
            href="https://cardimensteffywedding.com/">cardimensteffywedding.com</a>. The deployment configuration of
        this site is done through a combination of Git, cPanel (the hosting site I use), and cron jobs. When a change is
        merged into the main branch of this repo, cPanel's cron automation suite will send out a cron job to run and
        execute a PHP script to update the site.</p>
