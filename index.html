    <h1>Chris Cardimen</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello! If you hadn't already guessed, my name is Chris Cardimen. I'm a michigan-based software developer currently working at
        Jackson National Life. I do full-stack development, as well as website design
        and game development.</p>
    <h2>This website</h2>
    <p>This is my personal website, <a href="./index.html">chriscardimen.com</a>. I primarily use it as a portfolio and
        as a place to document my projects.</p>
    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    <p>The source code for this website is all publicly available on GitHub, under the <a
            href="https://github.com/chriscardimen/website-chriscardimen">website-chriscardimen</a> repository.</p>
    <p>The entire website has been handmade in classic barebones HTML. If you want to see
        my work with an engine (WordPress) that has more design features, check out the website I made for my wedding:
        <a href="https://cardimensteffywedding.com/">cardimensteffywedding.com</a>. The deployment configuration of
        this site is done through a combination of Git, cPanel (the hosting site I use), and cron jobs. When a change is
        merged into the main branch of this repo, cPanel's cron automation suite will send out a cron job to run and
        execute a PHP script to update the site.
    </p>
